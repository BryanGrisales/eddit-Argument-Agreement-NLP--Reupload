Here's the full text of the Tweet in question:

> @realDonaldTrump: My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!

It seems as though President Trump is quite explicitly and actively targeting Nordstrom because of his family's business engagements with the company. This could end up hurting Nordstrom, which could have a subsequent ""chilling"" effect that would discourage other companies from trifling with Trump family businesses. 

* Is this a conflict of interest? If so, how serious is it?

* Is this self dealing? I.e., is Trump's motive enrichment of himself or his family? Or might he have some other motive for doing this?

* Given that Trump made no pretenses about the purpose for his attack on Nordstrom, what does it say about how he envisions the duties of the President? Is the President concerned with conflict of interest or the perception thereof?

* What will be the consequences, and who might bring them about? Could a backlash from this event come in the form of a lawsuit? New legislation? Or simply discontentment among the electorate?","from usa today

ChangeMyView,CMV: being a conservative is the least Christ-like political view,34752,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/kvwbxj/cmv_being_a_conservative_is_the_least_christlike/,kvwbxj,1610472988.0,"From what I know, Christ was essentially a radical leftist. He was all about helping and loving the poor, hungry, disabled, outcast. He would feed 10 people just in case one was going hungry. He flipped a table when banks were trying to take advantage of people. He was anti-capitalist and pro social responsibility to support, love and respect all members of society. He was, based on location and era, probably a person of color. He would not stand for discrimination. He would overthrow an institution that treated people like crap.

On the other hand, conservatives are all about greed. They are not willing to help people in need (through governmental means) because they “didn’t earn it” and it’s “my tax dollars”. They are very pro-capitalism, and would let 10 people go hungry because one might not actually need the help. They do not believe in social responsibility, instead they prioritize the individual. Very dog eat dog world to them. And, while there are conservatives of color, in America most conservatives are at least a little bit racist (intentionally or not) because most do not recognize how racism can be institutional and generational. They think everyone has the same opportunities and you can just magically work your way out of poverty. 

Christ would be a radical leftist and conservatism is about as far as you can get from being Christ-like in politics. The Bible says nothing about abortion (it actually basically only says if someone makes a pregnant woman lose her baby, they have to pay the husband). It does not say homosexuality is sin, just that a man should not lie with a boy (basically, anti pedophilia) based on new translations not run through the filter of King James. Other arguments are based on Old Testament, which is not what Christianity focuses on. Jesus said forget that, listen to me (enter Christianity). Essentially all conservative arguments using the Bible are shaky at best. And if you just look at the overall message of Jesus, he would disagree with conservatives on almost everything.

EDIT: Wow, this is blowing up. I tried to respond to a lot of people. I tried to keep my post open (saying left instead of Democrat, saying Christian instead of Baptist or Protestant) to encourage more discussion on the differences between subgroups. It was not my intent to lump groups together.

Of course I am not the #1 most educated person in the world on these issues. I posted my opinion, which as a human, is of course flawed and even sometimes uninformed. I appreciate everyone who commented kindly, even if it was in disagreement.

I think this is a really interesting discussion and I genuinely enjoy hearing all the points of view. I’m trying to be more open minded about how conservative Christians can have the views they have, as from my irreligious upbringing, it seemed contradictory. I’ve learned a lot today!

I still think some conservatives do not live or operate in a Christ-like manner and yet thump the Bible to make political points, which is frustrating and the original inspiration for this point. However I now understand that that is not ALWAYS the case.","from what i know christ was essentially a radical leftist he was all about helping and loving the poor hungry disabled outcast he would feed  people just in case one was going hungry he flipped a table when banks were trying to take advantage of people he was anticapitalist and pro social responsibility to support love and respect all members of society he was based on location and era probably a person of color he would not stand for discrimination he would overthrow an institution that treated people like crap

on the other hand conservatives are all about greed they are not willing to help people in need through governmental means because they didnt earn it and its my tax dollars they are very procapitalism and would let  people go hungry because one might not actually need the help they do not believe in social responsibility instead they prioritize the individual very dog eat dog world to them and while there are conservatives of color in america most conservatives are at least a little bit racist intentionally or not because most do not recognize how racism can be institutional and generational they think everyone has the same opportunities and you can just magically work your way out of poverty 

christ would be a radical leftist and conservatism is about as far as you can get from being christlike in politics the bible says nothing about abortion it actually basically only says if someone makes a pregnant woman lose her baby they have to pay the husband it does not say homosexuality is sin just that a man should not lie with a boy basically anti pedophilia based on new translations not run through the filter of king james other arguments are based on old testament which is not what christianity focuses on jesus said forget that listen to me enter christianity essentially all conservative arguments using the bible are shaky at best and if you just look at the overall message of jesus he would disagree with conservatives on almost everything

edit wow this is blowing up i tried to respond to a lot of people i tried to keep my post open saying left instead of democrat saying christian instead of baptist or protestant to encourage more discussion on the differences between subgroups it was not my intent to lump groups together

of course i am not the  most educated person in the world on these issues i posted my opinion which as a human is of course flawed and even sometimes uninformed i appreciate everyone who commented kindly even if it was in disagreement

This disparity in where both sides of the political aisle gets their news from is what I believe is causing the massive division and polarization we see. We can't agree on basic facts of reality like whether the 2020 election was fair.

I think one clear measure we can take is enforcing anti-trust laws on broadcast and media companies. The fact that the conservative leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group covers 40% of American households, disproportionately in rural areas, is what is leading to the [brainwashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo&ab_channel=Deadspin) of these rural conservatives.

Another thing we can do is stop with this ""both sides"" meme. Both sides aren't just as bad when it comes to sensational media and disinformation. There is no left equivalent in terms of disinformation to QAnon. Like, we literally have QAnon supporters as congress people (i.e. Marjorie Taylor Greene). MSNBC or CNN never engaged in sensationalism on the level of the [birther movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories) that Fox News engaged in. Sure, MSNBC, CNN, Washington Post do attack Trump a lot, but they do it on issues that Trump should be attacked on. In contrast, remember when Fox News had a whole media cycle dedicated to [Obama ordering a burger with Dijon mustard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-WnoZbjdh4&ab_channel=TheDailyShowwithTrevorNoah)?

At the end of the day, I think it's safe to say that most Americans want less division, less polarization, some agreement and compromise so we can get things done (fixing poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, healthcare reform, immigration reform, etc.). But we can't accomplish any of that if we don't fix the vast disparity in our media and news consumption.","i would guess that a typical democrat gets their news from cnn msnbc washington post nyt etc and the average conservative gets his news from fox news talk radio oan breitbart the daily caller youtubers like stephen crowder and ben shapiro etc if you go more into the fringes of the right they probably get their news from qanon and other conspiracy facebook groups

ChangeMyView,"CMV: ""Folks"" is a reasonably inclusive, gender neutral term, and spelling it as ""folx"" is purely virtue signaling",28821,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/mglg30/cmv_folks_is_a_reasonably_inclusive_gender/,mglg30,1617125788.0,"I just want to start by saying this might be the only instance of something that I would actually, unironically call ""virtue signaling"" -- a term I usually disdain and find dismissive of social progress. But in this case, that's exactly what I think it is. 

""Folks"" is an inclusive word. It means ""people."" It is inherently gender neutral. It is perhaps one of the few English words to address a group of people that is totally inclusive and innocuous. In a time when we are critically evaluating the inclusiveness of language, one would think we're lucky to have a word as neutral and applicable as ""folks."" 

But apparently, people are intent on spelling it ""folx,"" with the ""x"" indicating inclusiveness. But adding a trendy letter to a word doesn't make the word more inclusive if the word was already inclusive. ""Folks"" didn't exclude people who were non-binary (for instance), because it inherently means ""people"" -- so unless you think non-binary folx aren't *people*, then they were already included and accepted in that term.

I understand there is value in making sure that language is obviously inclusive when speaking to people who may otherwise feel excluded. So, I understand there may be *some* value in taking a word that is potentially vague in its inclusiveness, and tweaking it in a way that is more inclusive. As an example, I understand the intent and value in the term ""latinx"" (which could be its own discussion, but I'm just citing it as a contrary example here). Regardless of someone's feelings on ""latinos/latinas,"" ""latinx"" is a substantive change that would, in theory, have more inclusiveness for those who might feel othered by the gendered terms.  

But ""folx"" doesn't add or change anything on a substantive level. It is purely a spelling change in a situation where the original spelling was not problematic or exclusive. It uses the letter ""x"" as a reference to the fact that ""x"" has become a signifier of inclusiveness, thereby showing that the user supports inclusiveness. But if people wouldn't have felt excluded otherwise, then signifying this is purely for the user's own ego -- to say, ""Look at what type of person I am; you should feel accepted by me."" Signaling that you're a good person in a way that doesn't change anything else or help your audience (since there wasn't a problem to begin with) is, by definition, virtue signaling. 

The only conceivable reason I see for the rally behind ""folx"" is the historical usage of ""volk"" in Germany, when Nazi Germany referred to ""the people"" as part of their nationalist identity. But 1) that's a different word in a different language which carries none of that baggage in English-speaking cultures; 2) it's a such a common, generally applicable word that its inclusion within political rhetoric shouldn't forever change the world itself, especially given its common and unproblematic usage for decades since then; and 3) this feels like a shoe-horned, insincere argument that someone might raise as a way to retroactively inject purpose into what is, in actuality, their virtue signaling. And if you were previously unfamiliar with this argument from German history, then that underscores my point about how inconsequential it is to Western English-speaking society. 

People who spell it as ""folx"" are not mitigating any harm by doing so, and are therefore doing it purely for their own sense of virtue. CMV.

*Addendum*: I'm not arguing for anyone to stop using this word. I'm not saying this word is harmful. I'm not trying to police anyone's language. I'm saying the word's spelling is self-serving and unhelpful relative to other attempts at inclusive language.    

*Addendums*: By far the most common response is an acknowledgement that ""folks"" is inclusive, but also that ""folx"" is a way to signal that the user is an accepting person. I don't see how this isn't, by definition, virtue signaling.

*Addendum 3*: I'm not making a claim of how widespread this is, nor a value judgment of how widespread it should be, but I promise this is a term that is used among some people. Stating that you've never seen this used doesn't contribute to the discussion, and claiming that I'm making this up is obnoxious.

I have changed my mind for three reasons. 

1) Test-taking ability is not necessarily an indication of one's ability to run the office of the president. 

2) He who creates the questions dictates the barrier for entry. 

3) Freedom of speech is a slippery slope, and even though announcing one's intent to run for president can and will continue to be abused, you can't knock out one brick and expect the wall to remain intact. Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. 

I still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. 

Regardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! 

---- Original Post ----

The office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. 

To limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. 

The results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.

While these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon.","edit ok this has been fun and some great conversation but i am beginning to feel like a oneman army trying to defend the gates of sparta
