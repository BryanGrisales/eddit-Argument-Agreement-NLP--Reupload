She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\n\nIt seems as though President Trump is quite explicitly and actively targeting Nordstrom because of his family's business engagements with the company. This could end up hurting Nordstrom, which could have a subsequent \"chilling\" effect that would discourage other companies from trifling with Trump family businesses. \n\n* Is this a conflict of interest? If so, how serious is it?\n\n* Is this self dealing? I.e., is Trump's motive enrichment of himself or his family? Or might he have some other motive for doing this?\n\n* Given that Trump made no pretenses about the purpose for his attack on Nordstrom, what does it say about how he envisions the duties of the President? Is the President concerned with conflict of interest or the perception thereof?\n\n* What will be the consequences, and who might bring them about? Could a backlash from this event come in the form of a lawsuit? New legislation? Or simply discontentment among the electorate?"

While I do not believe the rich should give up their fortunes, I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point. \n\nCertain media outlets claim that taxing the super wealthy is unfair and would be detrimental to those below them due to \"trickle down\" effects. There is also rhetoric that many self made billionaires worked hard for their fortunes, and that if we as Americans work hard, we might be rich ourselves one day.\n\nI believe that moving forward, we should push for much higher taxes on those earning/worth more than 1 billion USD. If the money Bloomberg spent on his campaign went to actual communities that need funding, actual change could have been possible. Social programs could benefit greatly from these funds, and maybe we could afford to better fund national programs such as healthcare or family leave."

He would feed 10 people just in case one was going hungry. He flipped a table when banks were trying to take advantage of people. He was anti-capitalist and pro social responsibility to support, love and respect all members of society. He was, based on location and era, probably a person of color. He would not stand for discrimination. He would overthrow an institution that treated people like crap.\n\nOn the other hand, conservatives are all about greed. They are not willing to help people in need (through governmental means) because they \u201cdidn\u2019t earn it\u201d and it\u2019s \u201cmy tax dollars\u201d. They are very pro-capitalism, and would let 10 people go hungry because one might not actually need the help. They do not believe in social responsibility, instead they prioritize the individual. Very dog eat dog world to them. And, while there are conservatives of color, in America most conservatives are at least a little bit racist (intentionally or not) because most do not recognize how racism can be institutional and generational. They think everyone has the same opportunities and you can just magically work your way out of poverty. \n\nChrist would be a radical leftist and conservatism is about as far as you can get from being Christ-like in politics. The Bible says nothing about abortion (it actually basically only says if someone makes a pregnant woman lose her baby, they have to pay the husband). It does not say homosexuality is sin, just that a man should not lie with a boy (basically, anti pedophilia) based on new translations not run through the filter of King James. Other arguments are based on Old Testament, which is not what Christianity focuses on. Jesus said forget that, listen to me (enter Christianity). Essentially all conservative arguments using the Bible are shaky at best. And if you just look at the overall message of Jesus, he would disagree with conservatives on almost everything.\n\nEDIT: Wow, this is blowing up. I tried to respond to a lot of people. I tried to keep my post open (saying left instead of Democrat, saying Christian instead of Baptist or Protestant) to encourage more discussion on the differences between subgroups. It was not my intent to lump groups together.\n\nOf course I am not the #1 most educated person in the world on these issues. I posted my opinion, which as a human, is of course flawed and even sometimes uninformed. I appreciate everyone who commented kindly, even if it was in disagreement.\n\nI think this is a really interesting discussion and I genuinely enjoy hearing all the points of view. I\u2019m trying to be more open minded about how conservative Christians can have the views they have, as from my irreligious upbringing, it seemed contradictory. I\u2019ve learned a lot today!\n\nI still think some conservatives do not live or operate in a Christ-like manner and yet thump the Bible to make political points, which is frustrating and the original inspiration for this point.

The ethics rules really just obscure behind a thin veneer the truth of American politics: namely, many politicians are just in it for their friends and donors. \n\nWe shouldn't hide it anymore. Make these allegiances visible, front-and-center. \n\nWe should make it mandatory for politicians appearing in public to wear NASCAR-style jumpsuits with their major sponsors emblazoned across their bodies. Then we'll more readily know who they're beholden to and which companies we may want to boycott or patronize. \n\nChange my view."

We can't agree on basic facts of reality like whether the 2020 election was fair.\n\nI think one clear measure we can take is enforcing anti-trust laws on broadcast and media companies. The fact that the conservative leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group covers 40% of American households, disproportionately in rural areas, is what is leading to the [brainwashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo&ab_channel=Deadspin) of these rural conservatives.\n\nAnother thing we can do is stop with this \"both sides\" meme. Both sides aren't just as bad when it comes to sensational media and disinformation. There is no left equivalent in terms of disinformation to QAnon. Like, we literally have QAnon supporters as congress people (i.e. Marjorie Taylor Greene). MSNBC or CNN never engaged in sensationalism on the level of the [birther movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories) that Fox News engaged in. Sure, MSNBC, CNN, Washington Post do attack Trump a lot, but they do it on issues that Trump should be attacked on. In contrast, remember when Fox News had a whole media cycle dedicated to [Obama ordering a burger with Dijon mustard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-WnoZbjdh4&ab_channel=TheDailyShowwithTrevorNoah)?\n\nAt the end of the day, I think it's safe to say that most Americans want less division, less polarization, some agreement and compromise so we can get things done (fixing poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, healthcare reform, immigration reform, etc.). But we can't accomplish any of that if we don't fix the vast disparity in our media and news consumption."

        "body": "I just want to start by saying this might be the only instance of something that I would actually, unironically call \"virtue signaling\" -- a term I usually disdain and find dismissive of social progress. But in this case, that's exactly what I think it is. \n\n\"Folks\" is an inclusive word. It means \"people.\" It is inherently gender neutral. It is perhaps one of the few English words to address a group of people that is totally inclusive and innocuous. In a time when we are critically evaluating the inclusiveness of language, one would think we're lucky to have a word as neutral and applicable as \"folks.\" \n\nBut apparently, people are intent on spelling it \"folx,\" with the \"x\" indicating inclusiveness. But adding a trendy letter to a word doesn't make the word more inclusive if the word was already inclusive. \"Folks\" didn't exclude people who were non-binary (for instance), because it inherently means \"people\" -- so unless you think non-binary folx aren't *people*, then they were already included and accepted in that term.\n\nI understand there is value in making sure that language is obviously inclusive when speaking to people who may otherwise feel excluded. So, I understand there may be *some* value in taking a word that is potentially vague in its inclusiveness, and tweaking it in a way that is more inclusive. As an example, I understand the intent and value in the term \"latinx\" (which could be its own discussion, but I'm just citing it as a contrary example here). Regardless of someone's feelings on \"latinos/latinas,\" \"latinx\" is a substantive change that would, in theory, have more inclusiveness for those who might feel othered by the gendered terms.  \n\nBut \"folx\" doesn't add or change anything on a substantive level. It is purely a spelling change in a situation where the original spelling was not problematic or exclusive. It uses the letter \"x\" as a reference to the fact that \"x\" has become a signifier of inclusiveness, thereby showing that the user supports inclusiveness. But if people wouldn't have felt excluded otherwise, then signifying this is purely for the user's own ego -- to say, \"Look at what type of person I am; you should feel accepted by me.\" Signaling that you're a good person in a way that doesn't change anything else or help your audience (since there wasn't a problem to begin with) is, by definition, virtue signaling. \n\nThe only conceivable reason I see for the rally behind \"folx\" is the historical usage of \"volk\" in Germany, when Nazi Germany referred to \"the people\" as part of their nationalist identity. But 1) that's a different word in a different language which carries none of that baggage in English-speaking cultures; 2) it's a such a common, generally applicable word that its inclusion within political rhetoric shouldn't forever change the world itself, especially given its common and unproblematic usage for decades since then; and 3) this feels like a shoe-horned, insincere argument that someone might raise as a way to retroactively inject purpose into what is, in actuality, their virtue signaling. And if you were previously unfamiliar with this argument from German history, then that underscores my point about how inconsequential it is to Western English-speaking society. \n\nPeople who spell it as \"folx\" are not mitigating any harm by doing so, and are therefore doing it purely for their own sense of virtue. CMV.\n___\n*Addendum*: I'm not arguing for anyone to stop using this word. I'm not saying this word is harmful. I'm not trying to police anyone's language. I'm saying the word's spelling is self-serving and unhelpful relative to other attempts at inclusive language.    \n\n*Addendums*: By far the most common response is an acknowledgement that \"folks\" is inclusive, but also that \"folx\" is a way to signal that the user is an accepting person. I don't see how this isn't, by definition, virtue signaling.\n\n*Addendum 3*: I'm not making a claim of how widespread this is, nor a value judgment of how widespread it should be, but I promise this is a term that is used among some people. Stating that you've never seen this used doesn't contribute to the discussion, and claiming that I'm making this up is obnoxious.\n\n*Addendum Resurrection*: Read the sidebar rules. Top level comments are to challenge the view and engage in honest discussion. If you're just dropping in from the front page to leave a snarky comment about how you hate liberals, you're getting reported 2 times over. Thanx.\n\n*Addendum vs. Editor*: Read my first few sentences. I used the term \"virtue signaling\" very purposefully. If you want to rant about everything you perceive to be virtue signaling, or tell me that you didn't read this post because it says virtue signaling, your viewpoint is too extreme/reductionist.\n\n*Addendum vs. Editor, Requiem*: The mods must hate me for the amount of rule 1 & 3 reports I've submitted."

Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. \n\nI still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. \n\nRegardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! \n\n---- Original Post ----\n\nThe office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. \n\nTo limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. \n\nThe results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.\n\nWhile these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon."
